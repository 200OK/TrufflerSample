In build 80, corresponding to assembly version 1.0.0.80, significant internal changes were made to the search functionality. The most important change was that the returned object from the Client.Search<T>() and Client.Search<T>(Language) methods was made immutable. This type, ISearchRequest and other interfaces that implemented it has also changed names to simply ISearch. Furthermore the class SearchQueryResult had its name changed to SearchResults.
Other than the naming changes and the immutability of the Search/SearchRequest class no major changes were made to the public API, although functionality related to searching and filtering was greatly improved.
